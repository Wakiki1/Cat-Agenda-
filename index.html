        <h2>What is Cat Agenda?</h2>
        <p>Cat Agenda is a student-centered organizational app designed to keep college students up to date with all assignments, announcements, and class activities. Unlike other apps, Cat Agenda connects directly with your institution to ensure you're always informed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatically syncs with your school's course information</li>
            <li>Central hub for assignments, announcements, and deadlines</li>
            <li>Weekly and monthly planning tools for study sessions</li>
            <li>Easy-to-navigate interface focused on student needs</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="comparison" class="alternatives">
        <h2>Why Cat Agenda?</h2>
        <p>We researched popular apps like Pulse, MyStudentLife, and iStudiez:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pulse:</strong> Glitchy, limited to D2L schools, discouraged by faculty</li>
            <li><strong>MyStudentLife:</strong> Study-based, lacks announcement integration, requires personalized setup</li>
            <li><strong>iStudiez:</strong> Focus on note organization and personal study planning</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cat Agenda</strong> stands apart by offering direct institutional connection, wide promotion through campuses, and community-wide student use to keep everyone in sync.</p>
